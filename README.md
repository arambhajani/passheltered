## Introduction
A password manager is a software application that is used to store and manage the passwords that a user has for various online accounts and security features. Password managers store the passwords in an encrypted format and provide secure access to all the password information with the help of a master password.
## Methodology 
Python too supports file handling and allows users
 to handle files i.e.,to read and write files, along
 with many other file handling options, to operate on files.

## Conclusion
Hence the Passheltered (Password Manager) can be used to manage our passwords in future and as always to secure our passwords Make use of other access control mechanisms
to facilitate password management and reduce the effort required by users in memorising a large number of passwords. This should be enforced with good security 
policies and guidelines, supported by user awareness training and education on the best practices in choosing and handling passwords.
